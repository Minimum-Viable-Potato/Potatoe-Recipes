            <p> I decided to switch careers about a year ago.  After dedicating myself to a job for over 9 years and after being laid off; I started to feel burnt out. I've always loved computer science and tech and have wanted to work in that field. In college I learned basic HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript and at a previous position I taught myself SQL. After learning SQL a new profound love for programming was born. My drive for learning and curious nature is one of my best skill sets because I adapt quickly, embrace change and network my skills with others. Working for a company that allows me to continuously learn, be creative and not micromanaged would be my ideal future job.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™m currently a Sr Technical Program Manager at Amazon Web Services (AWS) where I work on a team that helps scale the AWS network to meet increasing customer needs. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to take apart complicated problems and driving the delivery of a solutions. My experiences before AWS ranges from leading IT teams in the US military to managing Merger and Acquisition deals within the technology space. With my added technical experience as a software developer, I am well suited to not only handle the strategic decision-making needed to deliver lasting improvement to software, but also troubleshoot and unblock developers when technical issues arise.</p>
