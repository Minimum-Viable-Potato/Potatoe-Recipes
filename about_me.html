            <p> I decided to switch careers about a year ago.  After dedicating myself to a job for over 9 years and after being laid off; I started to feel burnt out. I've always loved computer science and tech and have wanted to work in that field. In college I learned basic HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript and at a previous position I taught myself SQL. After learning SQL a new profound love for programming was born. My drive for learning and curious nature is one of my best skill sets because I adapt quickly, embrace change and network my skills with others. Working for a company that allows me to continuously learn, be creative and not micromanaged would be my ideal future job.</p>
