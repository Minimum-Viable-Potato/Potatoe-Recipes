            <p> I am a software engineer with over 13 years in the Medical field, 7 years in Leadership and 2 years working as a Business Analyst. My career goals are to align myself in a technical field and leverage my skills and experience within that role. My drive to learn and enhance my skills are my best qualities. My Kryptonite is Potatoes (cooked anyway).

            <p> Hi! My name is Ryan and I am a software developer!  I spent the past 3 years working in sales, I enjoy my line of work but decided I wanted to explore another career path!  I decided to explore some free online coding classes and realized I loved the problem solving aspect of coding.  I would love to learn this skill in order to take advantage of opportunities within my current company.  My people skills that I've learned while working in sales help me more effectively communicate on projects and outside my organization.</p>

            <p>I’m currently a Sr Technical Program Manager at Amazon Web Services (AWS) where I work on a team that helps scale the AWS network to meet increasing customer needs. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to take apart complicated problems and driving the delivery of a solutions. My experiences before AWS ranges from leading IT teams in the US military to managing Merger and Acquisition deals within the technology space. With my added technical experience as a software developer, I am well suited to not only handle the strategic decision-making needed to deliver lasting improvement to software, but also troubleshoot and unblock developers when technical issues arise.</p>
